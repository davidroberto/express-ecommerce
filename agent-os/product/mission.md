# Product Mission

## Pitch
Express E-Commerce is an educational platform that helps students learn web development fundamentals by building a complete e-commerce application from scratch. Through hands-on experience with industry-standard technologies, students gain practical skills in backend development, database design, API creation, and testing while understanding real-world business logic.

## The Problem

### Bridging Theory and Practice
Students often learn programming concepts in isolation without understanding how they integrate into complete, production-ready applications. They struggle to translate theoretical knowledge into working software, particularly in complex domains like e-commerce that involve multiple interconnected features.

**Our Solution:** A progressively complex e-commerce platform that introduces fundamental concepts first (CRUD operations, REST APIs) and builds toward advanced topics (authentication, transactions, order management) in a logical, dependency-based sequence.

### Understanding Real Business Logic
Many learning projects focus on technical implementation without teaching the business logic and domain modeling critical for professional development. Students can write code but struggle to design systems that solve real business problems.

**Our Solution:** Authentic e-commerce workflows including inventory management, shopping carts, checkout processes, and order fulfillment that mirror production systems while remaining accessible to learners.

### Learning Modern Architecture
Traditional tutorials often teach monolithic, tightly-coupled code that doesn't reflect modern software architecture principles. Students graduate without understanding clean architecture, dependency inversion, or testability.

**Our Solution:** A codebase structured using clean architecture principles with clear separation of concerns, demonstrating use cases, repositories, entities, and proper dependency management from the start.

## Differentiators

### Educational-First Architecture
Unlike production e-commerce platforms optimized for scale and features, our codebase prioritizes clarity, learning progression, and best-practice demonstration. Every architectural decision is made with student comprehension in mind.

This results in code that's easier to understand, extend, and learn from while still reflecting professional standards.

### Progressive Complexity Model
Unlike all-or-nothing tutorials, we provide a roadmap that builds from foundational features to advanced capabilities. Students can stop at any checkpoint with a working, testable feature set.

This results in consistent wins, maintained motivation, and the ability to adapt the project to different skill levels and timeframes.

### Modern Testing Practices
Unlike many educational projects that skip testing or treat it as optional, our platform integrates testing from day one using industry-standard tools (Jest, Testcontainers). Students learn to write testable code and understand test-driven development.

This results in graduates who can write production-quality, maintainable code with confidence.

### Domain-Driven Design Foundation
Unlike generic CRUD tutorials, we teach domain modeling through the lens of e-commerce business logic. Students learn to identify entities, model relationships, and implement business rules rather than just copying boilerplate.

This results in developers who can analyze requirements and design appropriate data models for any domain.

## Key Features

### Core Features
- **Product Catalog Management:** Students learn CRUD operations, database design, and REST API patterns by implementing product creation, retrieval, updating, and deletion with proper validation
- **Inventory Tracking:** Introduces state management and business rules by tracking product quantities, handling stock updates, and preventing overselling

### Customer Experience Features
- **Shopping Cart:** Demonstrates session management, stateful operations, and cart persistence while handling add/remove/update operations
- **Order Placement:** Integrates multiple concepts including transactions, data validation, inventory coordination, and order state management
- **Order History:** Teaches data querying, filtering, and relationship loading to display customer purchase history with proper authorization

### Authentication & Security Features
- **User Registration & Login:** Introduces authentication concepts, password hashing, JWT tokens, and secure credential management
- **Role-Based Access:** Demonstrates authorization patterns by separating customer and admin capabilities with proper permission checks
- **Session Management:** Teaches secure session handling, token refresh strategies, and logout functionality

### Advanced Features
